## editing the website

Go into `./jekyll_proj`, change any files as needed. Recommend copying the folder to your machine and hosting a php server on the built static site as you go along.

## building the website

1. **ALWAYS** build from the project root (the directory containing this README).
2. Running `./build_site` builds your changed Jekyll to the static `_site`.
3. `docker-compose restart` to plug the changes into the running Docker container.

That's it! Have fun :)
