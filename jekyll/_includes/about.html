    <span class="talk-abstract">
      The web platform's openness and composability provide many benefits. 
      Yet, the ability for websites to interact with each other has provided many opportunities for attacks that abuse the core principles of the web.
      With the evolution of web frameworks and browsers, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross- Site Request Forgery (CSRF) have become increasingly rare. 
      In response, new classes of client-side vulnerabilities have emerged - DOM clobbering, XS-Leaks and client-side path traversals are just a few examples.
      In this talk, we will explore the merits and potential pitfalls of various protections against XSS and CSRF, newer classes of client-side attacks and some real-world examples of their applications.

      Linus's law posits that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". 
      I wanted to put this to the test and efficiently find security bugs in top GitHub projects. 
      In this talk I run through various ways of running queries over a large corpus of open source repos. 
      We'll look at the pros and cons of using the new GitHub CodeSearch, BigQuery, grep.app, CodeQL, or ripgrepping all the cloned code on your local machine. 
      I show how this led to a finding in the #1 most starred GitHub repo, freeCodeCamp, giving me every coding certification in a single request. 
      I conclude by investigating how open source maintainers can benefit from this work.

      We'll give a brief summary of the main results, and then finish with a deep-dive into some of the limitations of MTE when used for security purposes, and a discussion of the way that MTE both enabled discovery of, and impacted exploitability of, a Telegram zero-click vulnerability.
