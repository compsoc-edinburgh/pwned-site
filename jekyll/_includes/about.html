But how does playing CTFs compare to the actual work of being a pentester and finding bugs in software? You might be surprised!</td>

      <td>Website fingerprinting is a family of traffic analysis techniques that allow a network observer to learn information about the web pages visited over encrypted and anonymized channels. In this talk, I will give an overview of the state of the research on website fingerprinting, I will dive into the technical details of the implementation of some known website fingerprinting attacks, and discuss the deployment and practicality of such attacks in the real world.</td>

      <td>In the recent years more and more commercial applications (especially in the mobile market) are applying obfuscation methods on their programs. Malware has been doing this for decades but as research and tooling in these areas advanced most simple techniques are no longer hindering analysis or are easy to remove. Instead more formal techniques are used and in this talk we will explore some of those, their weaknesses, methods of strengthening them and the trade offs involved.</td>

      <td>Exploring Competitive Aspects of Synchronization in Shared Environments</td>
      <td>In shared environments such as operating systems, multiple tenants with varied requirements compete to access the shared resources, making strong performance isolation necessary. Locks are widely used synchronization primitives that provide mutual exclusion in such environments. In this talk, we will emphasize the competitive aspects of synchronization in such shared environments. We will start by introducing the notion of lock usage ‚Äî a new lock property that deals with the time spent in the critical section. Then, we will see how unfair lock usage in shared environments leads to a new problem of adversarial synchronization resulting in poor performance and denial-of-services. Next, using the inode cache in the Linux kernel, we introduce two new class of attacks ‚Äì synchronization and framing attacks that exploit kernel synchronization to harm application performance. Lastly, we will discuss the design of TrƒÅt·πõ ‚Äî a Linux kernel extension that can detect and mitigate synchronization and framing attacks with low overhead, prevent attacks from worsening, and recover by repairing data structures to their pre-attack state. We will briefly examine the evaluation to understand how TrƒÅt·πõ can handle such attacks efficiently and effectively.</td>
