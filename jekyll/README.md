# Running locally

In order to compile the assets and run `Jekyll` locally you need to follow those steps:

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in this directory
2. If your ruby version is different, run `bundle check`, then `bundle update`.
3. Make sure that the `Gemfile` has its corresponding packages.
3. Open `localhost:4000` in your web browser
