  # - title: "Electromagnetic eavesdropping: extracting screen content from radio waves"
  #   abstract:
  #     Voltage changes in electronic circuits cause them to emit electromagnetic waves.
  #     The weak signals emitted by monitors and associated cabling can be captured and processed to recover readable
  #     images from a distance.
  #     In this talk, I will give an overview of emissions security, the history of these attacks, and explain how and why
  #     electromagnetic eavesdropping on computer monitors works (hopefully in a way that doesn't require prior signal
  #     processing knowledge).
